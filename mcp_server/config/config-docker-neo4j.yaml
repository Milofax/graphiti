  # Entity types based on Schema.org, IEEE 830, and Dublin Core standards
  #
  # DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
  # - Fields = Intrinsic scalar values (dates, numbers, enums, identifiers, contact info)
  # - Edges = Relationships to other entities (extracted automatically by LLM)
  #   Example: Person→Organization is an EDGE, not a field "affiliation"
  #
  # DO NOT add fields for relationships - the LLM creates edges automatically:
  #   ✗ Person.affiliation (wrong - should be edge Person→Organization)
  #   ✗ Organization.location (wrong - should be edge Organization→Location)
  #   ✓ Person.birth_date (correct - scalar value)
  #   ✓ Person.email (correct - contact identifier)
